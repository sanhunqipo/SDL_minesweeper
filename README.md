An individual project I did in the summer of 2022 to learn C more in depth, made in SDL2. It is a clone of minesweeper.

NOTE: as the project is old, the Makefile does not work correctly. But, by using the object files generated by make, you can finish the compilation manually.

All graphics and audio are made by me. Everything is free to use under the GPLv3 license.
